    q: 'What is the starting salary for a government school teacher in Tamil Nadu after B.Ed?',
    a: 'A newly recruited government school teacher in Tamil Nadu (Grade II / BT Assistant) earns approximately ₹35,900 per month basic pay under the 7th Pay Commission, along with DA, HRA, and other allowances. The total in-hand salary typically ranges from ₹45,000 to ₹55,000 per month depending on posting location.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is B.Ed alone enough to get a government teaching job in Tamil Nadu?',
    a: 'No. A B.Ed degree is the mandatory qualification, but you must additionally qualify the TNTET (Tamil Nadu Teacher Eligibility Test) — either Paper I (Classes 1–5) or Paper II (Classes 6–8) — and then appear in TRB (Teacher Recruitment Board) examinations for actual appointment. JKKN College of Education integrates TNTET preparation into its curriculum to help students clear the exam promptly after graduation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I become a lecturer in a college with just a B.Ed degree?',
    a: 'No. For college-level teaching, you need a minimum of M.Ed (Master of Education) for education departments, or a Master\'s degree with NET/SET qualification for other subjects. After M.Ed and NET/SET clearance, you can apply for Assistant Professor positions in B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges. A Ph.D further strengthens academic career prospects.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which B.Ed specialization has the most career opportunities in 2026?',
    a: 'Mathematics, Science (Physics/Chemistry/Biology), and Computer Science B.Ed specializations have the highest demand in both government and private schools. Tamil and English language specialists are also consistently in demand. Commerce and Social Science specializations offer strong placement in CBSE and ICSE schools in urban areas.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the career options after B.Ed other than school teaching?',
    a: 'Beyond school teaching, B.Ed graduates can pursue roles in Ed-Tech companies (as content developers, online tutors, or instructional designers), education NGOs, coaching institutes, curriculum development firms, education journalism, and school administration. Entrepreneurial graduates also establish their own coaching centers, tutorial institutions, and private schools.',

                The career landscape for B.Ed graduates in India has transformed significantly over

                Ed-Tech, private coaching institutions, international schools, and education-focused
                NGOs has created a diverse ecosystem of opportunities for trained teachers.

                school education system. The demand for qualified B.Ed teachers is projected to
                grow steadily as the Right to Education Act continues to drive expansion of
                government school infrastructure and as private schools raise their hiring standards.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Private schools — including <strong>CBSE, ICSE, State Board, and international
                curriculum</strong> institutions — are among the largest employers of B.Ed
                graduates. Unlike government recruitment, private schools hire directly and
                throughout the year, making this a faster entry point into the teaching profession.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                CBSE-affiliated schools have a legal requirement under NCTE norms to employ only
                B.Ed-qualified teachers for secondary and senior secondary classes. This has
                created a strong, consistent demand for B.Ed graduates with subject expertise.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-5">
                Salaries in private schools vary widely — from ₹15,000 per month at smaller
                institutions to ₹40,000–₹60,000 per month at reputed CBSE or international
                schools in urban areas. Experienced teachers with 5+ years and a proven track
                record can command significantly higher packages.
